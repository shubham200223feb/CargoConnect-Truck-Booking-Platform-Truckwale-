CargoConnect is a web-based application that provides two separate interfaces — one for customers and another for transporters. On the customer side, users can explore a list of available transporters and apply filters based on city, state, and truck capacity to find the most suitable option for their needs. On the transporter side, fleet owners can manage their trucks, update availability, and monitor status in real time — distinguishing between vacant trucks and those currently on trip. This dual-UI design ensures seamless coordination between users looking to book transport and transporters managing their fleets.
